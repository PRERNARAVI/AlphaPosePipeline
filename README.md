This is a customized pipeline for AlphaPose - a multi-person, open source pose estimator. The original code for this pipeline comes from <a href=https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose/tree/master>here</a>. The trained models used to generate hand, body and face features can be found here <a href=https://github.com/PRERNARAVI/AlphaPosePipeline/tree/main/models>here</a>. 

This pipeline is currently being used by us to generate features for video data compiled for the Computer Vision based American Sign Language Recognition Game - CopyCat.
