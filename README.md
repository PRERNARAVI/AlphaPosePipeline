This is a customized pipeline for AlphaPose - a multi-person, open source pose estimator. The original code for this pipeline comes from <a href=https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose/tree/master>here</a>. The trained models used to generate hand, body and face features can be found here <a href=https://github.com/MVIG-SJTU/AlphaPose/tree/pytorch#installation>here</a>. 

This pipeline is currently being used by us to generate features for video data compiled for the Computer Vision based American Sign Language Recognition Game - <a href=https://gvu.gatech.edu/research/projects/copycat-helping-young-deaf-children-acquire-language-skills-using-sign-language>CopyCat</a>.
